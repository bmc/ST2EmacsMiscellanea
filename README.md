# Some Sublime Text 2 Stuff

## Intro

This repo contains various hacks (keymaps, plugins, etc.) for the
[Sublime Text 2][] text editor.

[Sublime Text 2]: http://www.sublimetext.com/2

## Warning

I use these files myself, but *caveat user*. If you use them, and they screw you all to hell, it's not my fault.

## Plugins

### Installation

There are several ways to install these plugins.

NOTE: The plugins do _not_ install any key bindings by default. If you want to
use my key bindings, see below.

#### Via Package Control

If you're using Will Bond's [Package Control][] (and you should be):

First add this repository to your Package Control repo list. (This step won't
be necessary once the repository is listed in the master Package Control
repository list, which should be soon):

Go to the *Preferences > Packages Settings > Package Control > Settings - User*
menu. That will bring up `Package Control.sublime-settings` in a buffer. In the
resulting buffer, make sure "repositories" contains "https://github.com/bmc
/sublime-text-hacks". For instance, my file looks like this:

    {
      "auto_upgrade_last_run": 1322234232,
      "repositories":
      [
        "https://github.com/bmc/sublime-text-hacks"
      ]
    }

Then, pull up *Preferences > Package Control*, select
*Package Control: Install Package*, and search for "hacks". It should point
to this package, which you can then install.

To upgrade the package, just use the Package Control package upgrade 
capability.

[Package Control]: http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control

#### Manually


Go to your Sublime Text 2 `Packages` directory and clone the repository.
For instance, on Linux:

    $ cd ~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages
    $ git clone https://github.com/bmc/sublime-text-hacks

On Mac OS X:

    $ cd "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages"
    $ git clone https://github.com/bmc/sublime-text-hacks

It might be necessary to restart the editor.

To upgrade, just do a `git pull` within that directory.

### Plugin: *wrap_paragraph* command

The stock Sublime Text 2 `wrap_width` setting controls both on-screen wrapping
and the column at which the `wrap_lines` command folds lines. Those two
settings should be different; otherwise, paragraphs can wrap strangely on the
screen. `parawrap.py` contains a wrapper command called `wrap_paragraph` that
looks for a `wrap_paragraph` setting. If that setting is found, its (integer)
value is used to override `wrap_width`. Then, the `wrap_paragraph` command
invokes the stock `wrap_lines` command to wrap the paragraph.

See related bug report <http://sublimetext.userecho.com/topic/82731-/>

#### Settings

Sample settings:

    {
        // On screen, words wrap at 80.
        "wrap_width": 80,

        // When wrap_paragraph is invoked, words wrap at 79.
        "wrap_paragraph": 79,

        "rulers": [80]
    }

#### Key bindings

Bind `wrap_paragraph` to a key:

    { "keys": ["alt+q"], "command": "wrap_paragraph" },

### Plugin: *fixup_whitespace* command

Emacs has a function called `fixup-whitespace`, documented as:

> This function replaces all the horizontal whitespace surrounding point with
> either one space or no space, according to the context. It returns nil.
>
> At the beginning or end of a line, the appropriate amount of space is none.
> Before a character with close parenthesis syntax, or after a character with
> open parenthesis or expression-prefix syntax, no space is also appropriate.
> Otherwise, one space is appropriate.

(See the [Emacs fixup-whitespace command][] for details.)

This repo provides a plugin, in `plugsin/FixupWhitespace.py` that emulates the
Emacs `fixup-whitespace` command. By default, my key bindings (above) map
the function to *Alt-Space*.

[Emacs fixup-whitespace command]: http://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/User_002dLevel-Deletion.html#index-fixup_002dwhitespace-2569

### Plugin: *emacs_open_line* command

The `emacs_open_line` command inserts a newline at the cursor, without moving
the cursor. Map it to *Ctrl-o* to make *Ctrl-o* behave in a more traditional
Emacs-y way:

    { "keys": ["ctrl+o"], "command": "emacs_open_line" },

### Plugin: *recenter_in_view* command

The `recenter_in_view` command repositions the view so that the line containing
the cursor is at the center of the viewport, if possible. This command is
similar to the [Emacs `recenter_top_bottom` command][], typically bound to
*Ctrl-l* (i.e., *Control* + *lower-case L*). However, unlike the corresponding
Emacs command, this command does not cycle through scrolling positions. It
always repositions the view the same way, namely, so that the line containing
the cursor is in the center of the viewport, top to bottom.

My key bindings file (see below) binds this function to *Ctrl-l*.

[Emacs `recenter_top_bottom` command]: http://www.gnu.org/s/libtool/manual/emacs/Scrolling.html#index-recenter_002dtop_002dbottom-450

### Plugin: Emacs-like Syntax Setter

[GNU Emacs][] has a useful feature that allows an individual file to override
the default Emacs mode (and, hence, the associated language syntax and
colorization) by using a special magic string somewhere in the first non-blank
line of the file. (For documentation on this Emacs feature, see the Emacs
[Choosing Modes][] documentation node.)

[GNU Emacs]: http://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/
[Choosing Modes]: http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Choosing-Modes.html>

The `EmacsLikeSyntaxSetter.py` plugin, in this repository, provides a similar
capability for Sublime Text 2.

For instance, if file `foo.C` would normally be displayed using C syntax rules,
but you want to force Sublime Text 2 to use C++ rules, simply include a comment
like this in the first non-blank line of the file:

    //              -*- c++ -*-

Notes:

* The spaces between the `-*-` markers are optional, and any number of them is
  permitted (including none).
* The syntax name must match the name of a `.tmLanguage` file somewhere
  underneath your Sublime Text 2 `Packages` directory. The name is matched
  in a case-blind manner; thus, "Scala" and "scala" mean the same thing.
  
Thus, the following lines all set the buffer syntax to "Python":

    #  -*-python-*-
    #                    -*-        Python-*-
    #         -*- PyThOn -*-
    # -*- Python -*-

The plugin scans the buffer for a syntax-setting line under three
circumstances:

1. When you first load a file into a new view (buffer).
2. Right after you save a buffer.
3. When the buffer is activated (i.e., given keyboard focus).

If you're editing a file, and you change the syntax line, you'll either
have to save the buffer, or focus out and focus back on it, to force the
new syntax setting to take effect.

If the plugin fails to honor your syntax setting, see the Python console
(normally accessible via *Ctrl-`*). There may be a warning that's helpful.

**Note**: This plugin isn't a command; it's an event handler. Installing these
plugins automatically enables this particular plugin.

## Key and Mouse Bindings

### Mouse Bindings

The file `bindings/mousebindings.sublime-mousemaps` contains some mouse
bindings I find useful. They may or may not be useful to you. If you want to
use them, install them in your `Packages/User` directory. e.g.:

Linux:

    $ git clone https://github.com/bmc/sublime-text-hacks
    $ cd sublime-text-hacks
    $ cp bindings/mousebindings.sublime-mousemap ~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages/User

Mac OS X:

    $ git clone https://github.com/bmc/sublime-text-hacks
    $ cd sublime-text-hacks
    $ cp bindings/mousebindings.sublime-mousemap "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/User"

### Emacs-ish Key Bindings

The file `bindings/Emacsish-keybindings.sublime-keymap` provides various Emacs-
like key bindings for Sublime Text 2.

#### Prerequisites

By default, the key bindings use Stian Gryt√∏yr's Emacs-style *kill ring*
implementation, available at <https://github.com/stiang/EmacsKillRing>. If you
prefer the more standard, Windows-like cut-and-paste semantics, see the
`Emacsish-keybindings.sublime-keymap` file. You can comment out the kill ring
mappings and uncomment the cut-and-paste mappings, instead.

### Installation

There are two ways to install the key and mouse bindings: Via [Paver][]
and manually.

[Paver]: http://paver.github.com/paver/

#### Via Paver

If you don't have [Paver][] installed, you can install it easily with:

    $ pip install paver # sudo may be required on your system

Once Paver is installed, you can use it to install the just key bindings,
just the mouse bindings, or both:

    $ paver installkeybindings   # install just the key bindings
    $ paver installmousebindings # install just the mouse bindings
    $ paver installbindings      # install both key and mouse bindings

**WARNING**: These targets will removed your existing default bindings and
replace them with the ones in this repository. They do _not_ back your bindings
up first!

#### Manually

To install these bindings manually, check out this repository and copy the
files to the appropriate `Package/Users` directory for your platform, as shown
below:

* Linux: `~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages/User/Default (Linux).sublime-keymap
* Mac: `/Users/bmc/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/User/Default (OSX).sublime-keymap`
* Windows: `C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages\User\Default (Windows).sublime-keymap` 
  (**NOTE**: That's the path on *my* Windows 7 machine, with `username` 
  replaced by my user name, and using the non-portable version of 
  Sublime Text 2. YMMV.)

For instance, on Linux:

    $ git clone https://github.com/bmc/sublime-text-hacks
    $ cd sublime-text-hacks
    $ cp bindings/Emacsish-keybindings.sublime-keymap ~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages/User

If you've already installed the plugins, then you can simply get the
key bindings from your `Package/sublime-text-hacks/bindings` directory.

Note that it's *much* easier just to use [Paver][].

#### Non-Standard Emacs Key Bindings

* *Incremental Search* (not "regular search") is bound to *Ctrl-s*.
* *Ctrl-r* is bound to *Reverse Incremental Search*.
* *Alt-r* (*Command-r* on the Mac) is bound to *Search and Replace*.
* *Alt-s* (*Command-s* on the Mac) is bound to *Save*, as well, for consistency
  with TextMate and other Mac applications. (You can comment this out, or 
  rebind it.)
* *Ctrl-/* is bound to *Undo*, mostly because that's what I'm used to using.
* *Alt-z* (*Command-z* on the Mac) is also bound to *Undo*, for consistency
  with TextMate and other Mac applications.
* *Ctrl-Alt-n* is bound to *New File*.
* *Ctrl-Alt-o* is bound to *Open File*, as is the more standard Emacs
  *Ctrl-x Ctrl-f* key sequence.
* Pressing *Ctrl-s* repeatedly does not continue the incremental search.
  Use F3 for that. There may be a way to have *Ctrl-s* do what I want,
  perhaps by using contexts. I'm not sure how to do that yet.
* *Ctrl-q* maps to `wrap_paragraph` (see the `parawrap` plugin in this repo),
  for consistency with TextMate key bindings. *Alt-q* also maps to
  `wrap_paragraph`.
* Because I rebound *Ctrl-Q*, these bindings map *Ctrl-Alt-q* to `exit`.
* *Alt-Space* is bound to `fixup_whitespace`, which is implemented via my
  *fixup_whitespace* command, above.

#### Unexpected Oddities

With these bindings in place, the Sublime Text 2 menus may not be correct. For
instance, the file menu will still show the standard Sublime Text 2 bindings
for *Open File*, *New File* and *Save File*.
