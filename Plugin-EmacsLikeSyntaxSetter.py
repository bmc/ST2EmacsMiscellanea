    This plugin makes Sublime Text 2 mimic Emacs' behavior of setting
    the buffer syntax based on a special "mode line" somewhere in the
    first non-blank line of a buffer. For instance, if file "foo.C"
    would normally be displayed using C syntax rules, but you want to
    force Sublime to use C++ rules, simply include a comment like this
    in the first non-blank line of the file:

        -*- c++ -*-

    The name of the syntax must match a tmLanguage file somewhere
    under your Sublime "Packages" directory. The match is case-insensitive,
    and white space between the "-*-" markers is optional.
